I'm Moamen Osama, a Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems specialist currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Alexandria University's Faculty of Computer and Data Science. I'm expected to graduate in June 2026 and am based in Alexandria, Egypt.
I've developed strong expertise in Logistic Regression deployment and Natural Language Processing (NLP). To strengthen my skills, I've earned several key certifications including Advanced Learning Algorithms, Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification, AI Agents Fundamentals, and AWS Academy Cloud Foundations, which reflects my commitment to both machine learning theory and cloud computing applications.
My educational journey began at El Ekbal National School, where I completed my foundational studies from 2008 to 2022, before transitioning into my current AI-focused university program. I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning and intelligent systems, and I'm building expertise that positions me well in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.
